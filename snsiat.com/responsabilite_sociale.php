							<div class="content_block_info_white">Carlos García feels that his dream is coming true. Nevertheless, he does not lose his caring nature as a human being. He shares a commitment with his team members, well beyond legal contracts. All the workers at Victoria Farm are affiliated to Ecuadorian social security. They have free meals that gives a nutritious food service to the workers, and they have a medical clinic for their family members. Mr. García is grateful for the splendid response of the land and the local people. He has made substantial investments in the schools of Bajada de Progreso and San Cristóbal, two small rural villages. Victoria Farm provided computer equipment and infrastructure to raise the educational quality to local children.</div>
